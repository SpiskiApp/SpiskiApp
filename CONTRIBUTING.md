# Communication
We use English language for communication. It will allow to involve wider audience to development and support process.

# Development process
Each contribution is important, all ideas are valuable. However, to keep process organized, consider follow our plan and goals. We are pretty short at time and we must be realistic.

## Board
We use [Github Projects](https://github.com/unrealsolver/spiski_app/projects/1) for issues tracking.

## Task creation
Ideally, most of the code changes should start at task creation. Task should contain all information required to implement the feature.

## Workflow
1. Came up with an idea
2. Create a task
3. Discuss with a team, if makes sense
4. Pick a task and assign to yourself
5. Move to in progress
6. Done work
7. Move to done

# Code Style
Write your code according to python best practices. We use [blac](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting, hence 4 spaces indent and double quotes.
